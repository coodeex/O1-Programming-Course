/** The class `Match` represents match results in a football match statistics program.
  * A match is played between teams from two clubs: a home club and an away club.
  * Goals scored by players of either team can be added to the match object with the
  * method `addGoal`.
  *
  * The class is expected to be used so that a match object with no goals is initially
  * created as a real-life match starts. Goals are added incrementally as the match
  * progresses. (A match object has mutable state.)
  *
  * @param home  the club whose team plays at home in the match
  * @param away  the club whose team plays away in the match */
