    * Consider an example family tree:
    *
    *  - Odin has one child: Edie.
    *  - Edie has five children: Molly, Barbara, Calvin, Sam, and Walter.
    *  - Sam has three children: Dawn, Gus, and Greg.
    *  - Dawn has three children: Lewis, Milton, and Edith.
    *
    * This means that:
    *
    *  - Called on Odin, the method returns Edie, since she has five children;
    *    more than her parent Odin and more than any of her own descendants.
    *  - Called on Edie, the method returns Edie herself, for the same reason.
    *  - Called on Molly, the method returns Molly herself, even though she has
    *    no children.
    *  - Called on Sam, the method may return either Sam himself or Sam's daughter
    *    Dawn, both of whom have three children. */
